<h1>How make Airpods</h1>
     <p>Wireless Earphones are a very good device accessory since you can be moving at the same time. This way I am telling you is a very simple way to make your own DIY Airpods
        <ul>
          <li>Old Earphones</li>
          <li>Old TV remote</li>
          <li>Scissors or wire cutter</li>
          <li>Soldering kit</li>
          <li>Hot glue gun</li>
          <li>1 LED light</li>
        </ul>
       <ol>
          <h2>Get old earphones </h2>
          <li>Remember to get damaged and old earphones as new ones may come handy sometimes</li>
          <h2> Cut the earphones</h2>
          <li>Cut the earphones from the top leaving the earpiece and 1cm of wire</li>
          <h2>Get an old television remote</h2>
          <li>Then open the remote and then look at the top, get that sensor</li>
          <h2>Get the other bit of wire previously cutted</h2>
          <li>From that wire get the piece that is used to connect the earphones to the phone </li>
          <h2>Attach the sensor to the piece we previously cutted</h2>
          <li>Attach the previously cutted piece to the sensor so that it can detect the earpiece</li>
          <h2>Get 2 white LED lights</h2>
          <li>Attach 1 LED light to the end of one earpiece and the other to the other earpiece </li>
          <h2>Customizing the Airpods</h2>
          <li>Push the LED lights and sensor in so it is in place; you may use a hot glue gun</li>
          <h2>Test the Airpods</h2>
          <li>The connection piece is to be connected to the phone while you wear the earphones on your ear</li>
          <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
          <li>If the wireless earphones are not working try soldering the wires or see if the hot glue gun is insulating the wire</li>
          <h2>The case</h2>
          <li>After all the steps are done for the case you can get any small plastic box and put cotton in it leaving the only space for the Airpods </li>
       </ol>
